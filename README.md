# Compiling
This repo uses a few template files, which allows you to modifying the actual in-use files without creating conflicts.
This does however mean that you can't immediately compile the repo, there are a few things you need to do first.

1. Install Python. Make sure to install the dev headers.
   
2. Copy `Directory.Build.props.template` to `Directory.Build.props`.
   The template is set to read from your `PYTHONPATH`, you may need to overwrite this, especially if you're planning on compiling for both 32 and 64-bit.

3. (OPTIONAL) Copy `copy_build_to_game.bat.template` to `copy_build_to_game.bat`.
   This script is run post-build, taking the project configuration and platform, and path to the built SDK dll as args.
   You can use it to copy this file into your game directory for testing. You *will* need to manually modify it for your setup.
