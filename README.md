## Linux (SteamPlay/Proton and Wine)

PythonSDK does not yet work natively on Linux, but it seems to work well under SteamPlay/Proton and Wine.  To load properly, though, Wine needs to be told to allow `ddraw.dll` overrides.  Additionally, the latest SDK release (as of February 29, 2020) wants the main executable name to be `Borderlands2.exe`, so doing a symlink/copy for `Launcher.exe` won't work.  Simply set the game's launch options (via `Properties -> General`) to:

    WINEDLLOVERRIDES="ddraw=n,b" %command%
